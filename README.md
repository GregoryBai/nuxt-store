#### -Beyond the minimum- #### 
- Mobile version

#### -Done incorrectly- ####
- did not use css-modules, as I did not realize what it was when I was just starting off
- not pixel-perfect (not sure if this was a requirement)
- the '/' and '/catalogue' routes are virtually the same, you have to choose a caterogy in the NavBar to navigate further (e.g. to '/catalogue/2)

#### -To ask- #### 
- How to navigate from a route to itself but with a param
- How to add animations (transitions, as I could not figure out how to make they work)
- TS?
